    "It is also possible to look at the topology of an organisation or a project, and draw conclusions about how it should be managed, and how it could evolve. This is particularly useful when the database becomes very large, and groups of projects, for example, so interwoven as to make it difficult to see the wood for the trees."
    "We should work toward a universal linked information system, in which generality and portability are more important than fancy graphics techniques and complex extra facilities."

  TAGS : personal finance, economy, investment
  QOTE
    If you are not a finance expert, or an expert of the industry you are investing in _and_  intermediately knowledgeable in finance, you are going to be way better off buying index funds of various kinds.
    The less you touch or money and actively trade, the better you will do on average.
    Being “long” means you believe the macro forces at play are going to bring the etf / sector / company up over the long term and you are totally comfortable doing nothing on the peaks and dips, with a plan for what conditions you will sell for upfront (ie: in 5 years, if the stock price doubles, or when I want to buy a PINO).
    It's easier to predict economy on a macro scale, if you can tie it to systemic changes in global economy / industries / power structures, events...
    To reduce risk from volatility:
    1. Average your trades in and out: if you have enough money that the cost of trades is insignificant in relation to the cost of stock you are buying, you should purchase 1/n stock with a fixed frequency, n times. this averages out the volitility of the stock price over that period of time, giving you something closer to the macro value of the stock. You can do this when you sell, too.
    2. Rebalance your assets with a given frequency, say 1-4 times a year. If your due diligence is the same, you should still want to have the same percentage of your money in each of the areas you planned before. This means that if one of your stocks had _sick gains_, you should take those gains and put them with equal percentages into all of your investments, not just continue to bet on the stock that did well with that money. Rebalance your investment percentages back to what you originally decided.
    3. Update your due diligence. Are the macro forces that got you into the investments you have still relevant? What is the current status of the market you are investing in?

  TERM
    > FTUE: First-time user experience
  NOTE
    Learning how to play a game is where the fun comes from; Be careful however not to confuse the gameplay with its UI. The UI outside the gameplay needs to be clear and intuitive, especially at the beginning of the game, to ensure good FTUE.
    Tutorials need to be fun for the player, and that requires giving them agency during the tutorial.
    Tooltips are powerful way to teach things that are hard to explain to players in VR, so long as it's used in moderation. Reading is hard!
    Pick one between room-scale and seated experience, and stick with it. It's much work to design a game that has to satisfies both.
    Avoid designing the game for one VR controller, and use virtual objects player can interact with in game as UI. Current VR controllers aren't the same across platforms.

  NOTE
    Multiplayer games such as Overwatch & DotA struggle to design its audio. 
    One, because music have to be used sparsely in order to avoid repeating too much and annoying the players; and two, because the sound design affects game balance.
    Playing the music only before game starts give a sense of ceremony, and playing it toward the end of a game adds tension.
    Making footsteps audible, and providing in-game communication tools that are audio based, fill up the void of the soundscape while giving players crucial in-game information.

  QOTE : "But, above all, may they believe in themselves and become as helpless as children. For softness is great and strength is worthless. When a man is born, he is soft and pliable. When he dies, he is strong and hard. When a tree grows, it is soft and pliable. But when it's dry and hard, it dies. Hardness and strength are death's companions. Flexibility and softness are the embodiment of life. That which has become hard shall not triumph."

  QOTE
    "What you do in the game and how you do it is used as the catalyst to drive everything else."
    "I first take the character which you're going to control and replace them with a dot as a placeholder, then I think about what kind of movement would be fun." - Gunpei Yokoi
    "When you could interact with almost everything in the game by using [one strong main mechanic], Nintendo can make a game where the player's range of actions is very small and easy to learn, but the number of things they could interact with is huge."
    "(When it comes to Nintendo's sequels) it's about putting a new twist on an already established mechanics... put those old mechanics in interesting new contexts."
    "(By representing part of the game system, such as camera, targeting system... as characters,) gameplay needn't be abstract systems but organic part of the game world."
    "(Basing the story on the game's main mechanics) might seem like a crazy way to come up with a story, but it can help ensure there's a deep connection between what you do in the game, and what happens in the story."
    "When every aspect of the game is suggesting the way you play it, it becomes effortless to pick the game up and get stuck in."
  NOTE
    Super Mario: A game about jumping. Splatoon: firing ink. A Link Between Worlds: turning into a painting. Luigi's Mansion (gamecube): using a vacuum cleaner.
    All these games start with one single mechanics, and that determines everything from graphical style, sound design, user interface, characters, world setting, and even narrative.

  NOTE
    I played this game twice, in 12013 &amp; 12017. In both playthroughs I let the previous player pass, refused to mercy-kill Julia, and the next player let me pass too.
    It subverts the expectation that characters you interact with in game are NPCs.
    The choice between letting previous player pass or die examines how the player would behave when nobody's watching.
    The answers player types in for the next player, on the other hand, introduces a real vulnerability. The outcome isn't up to the player anymore.
  QOTE
    "There’s a certain codified language about how people approach games, and one of those things is that most of the characters you’ll interact with will be some pre-programmed thing, unless the game is explicitly a multiplayer one. I thought it was an interesting thing to subvert that expectation: you don’t realise the other player is actually a player. You see them as an NPC."
    "(Moirai) forced you to assess yourself: how you comport yourself when you think no one’s listening."

Using Anki to learn chords
  QOTE : "I would recommend putting in chord progressions (like in a normal song) rather than single chords. Also make sure to actually form the chords, either on the piano (definitely much better), or on the table (in a pinch). This will allow you to learn the chords in context and give your hands muscle memory, especially with common transitions."

Categorizing creative systems
  TYPE : quote
  DATE : 12018-11-13
  TAGS : generative
  DONE : true
  QOTE
    1. Domain & Creative Task: Does it produce poetry? music? visual art? cinema? game? If it produces music, does it compose? perform? improvise?

    2. How specific or generic is the system. e.g. AARON's output has a very specific style, while the Continuator can imitate many styles of music. Often, artistic systems are more specific, while researching / scientific systems are more generic.

    3. Level of autonomy. How much human involvement is needed? AARON paints new paintings on demand without any human input, while the continuator only works with a human partner.

    4. Interactivity: if the system interacts with human, and in what way. Low level interactivity: the system only reacts to its input, like most apps with a GUI. A text editor interacts with you this way. High level interactivity: aka Agent Interaction, or Conversational Interactivity. the actions of the creative system affects the actions of the human.

    5. Time: The generative process can happen in real time, or ahead of time.

    6. Origin of the system's knowledge. Encoded Knowledge, Input Knowledge, and Knowledge learned - extracted from some input data.

    7. System's pattern of behavior, as if they are artificial lives. Christopher Langton's 4 classes of behavior. Fixed behavior: static output. Periodic behavior: system has recurrent behaviors. Chaotic behavior: no discernable patterns. Complex behavior: the sweet spot between Periodic and Chaotic behavior. Where we can find the most intelligent outputs. ˀ"Complex" here refers to the output of the system, not the complexity of the process. 

    8. Architecture of the system. Purely generative system takes some input, and then simply outputs. Feedback loop or reflexive system separates the generation and evaluation; the evaluation affects the generation. Interactive, or adaptive system, adds the audience, user, or environment of the output into feedback.

    "So, to what I think was an order of events. I think a circle was drawn first; then the main pitches written as a cycle of fourths, with the position of each pitch being alternated between being inside or outside the circle. This would make the two whole tone scales...
    "From there, the subsidiary pitches were written in to produce the repetition of each scale, and then Coltrane grouped them, for reasons that were entirely related to theory and go beyond a chromatic modulation. I suspect the numbers were written on last, perhaps just after the connecting spokes were drawn."

  QOTE
    Innovation Trigger: A potential technology breakthrough kicks things off. Early proof-of-concept stories and media interest trigger significant publicity. Often no usable products exist and commercial viability is unproven.
    Peak of Inflated Expectations: Early publicity produces a number of success stories — often accompanied by scores of failures. Some companies take action; many do not.
    Trough of Disillusionment: Interest wanes as experiments and implementations fail to deliver. Producers of the technology shake out or fail. Investments continue only if the surviving providers improve their products to the satisfaction of early adopters.
    Slope of Enlightenment: More instances of how the technology can benefit the enterprise start to crystallize and become more widely understood. Second- and third-generation products appear from technology providers. More enterprises fund pilots; conservative companies remain cautious.
    Plateau of Productivity: Mainstream adoption starts to take off. Criteria for assessing provider viability are more clearly defined. The technology's broad market applicability and relevance are clearly paying off.

  QOTE : "Meteoric iron or 'sky-iron' (Tib. gnam lcags) is the supreme substance for forging the physical representation of the vajra or other iron weapons, since it has already been tempered by the celestial gods in its passage across the heavens. The indivisibility of form and emptiness is a perfect metaphor for the image of a meteorite or 'stone fallen from the sky', manifesting out of the voidness of space as a shooting star or fireball, and depositing a chunk of fused 'sky iron' on the earth below. Many vajras held by deities as weapons are described as being forged from meteorite iron, and Tibet, with its high altitude, thin atmosphere and desolate landscape, received an abundance of meteorite fragments. Tibetan vajras were often cast from meteorite iron, and as an act of sympathetic magic a piece of the meteoric iron was often returned to its original site."

  QOTE : "The four layers of Gehenna were infinite planes with gravity at a forty-five degree angle to the ground, making travelers feel as if they were on the side of a mountain with no base or peak. Anyone losing their footing could tumble for miles/kilometers before finding enough purchase on the slope to halt their fall."

  NOTE
    > Use a thick cut so that the outside has time to brown and form crust before the inside is dried out.
    > Pat the steak surface dry.
    > Season both sides evenly.
    > Make sure there's a good layer of fat underneath the steak, so it browns evenly.
    > Keep basting with those browned nutty butter. If butter got too burned, add more butter.
    > Inner temperature should be just around 50C.
    > Take it out of the pan and let rest for 5 minutes.
    > More butter!

Common Japanese Chord Progressions (Part 1)

  TYPE : video
  TAGS : rock, math rock, japanese music, japan, chord, music, music theory
  DATE : 12019-08-09
  NOTE
    > Interesting that japanese styles of progression is also found in CHON's music, and other math rock bands in the state. The influence could have came from video game and anime.
    > IV (V7) iii vi progression. The turnaround could be vi V IV, or vi V I IV (2-5-1)
    > IV V vi progression
    > {VI} chords. This is borrowed from A Major. This works because you can think of C Major as A minor. Use VIsus to add ambiguity and allow us to resolve to either VI or vi.
    > {bVII} chords. This can be seen as borrowed from the parallel minor, or as neapolitan chord of vi.

  TYPE : video
  TAGS : rock, math rock, japanese music, japan, chord, music, music theory
  DATE : 12019-08-11
  NOTE
    > IV iii progression. Simplified from IV iii vi. A floating feeling.
    > We can tell the key of a song without the tonic chord ever being used in the progression, by watching out for half-steps chord changes. If it's between a minor and major chord, it's iii and IV. If diminished and major, it's viidim and I.
    > maj#11 chord, or the lydian chord, is also a strong indicator of tonality. With IV as the root it's 3467 of the major scale it belongs to. the 4 and 7 wants to resolve to 3 and 1 (iii).
    > {viiº/vi} or {bviº}: the viiº chord borrowed from a harmonic minor scale from vi. Think of it as another way to approach vi. Can also try {bVI}
    > {bII/IV} or {#IV}: The neapolitan chord of IV - it's the 2nd chord of a phrygian (34567123) scale from IV. Think of it as another way to approach IV.

    > Synopsis: While technology always improves, human change at a much slower pace. We will always want a phone we can comfortably hold and keep in our pockets. And because our phone focuses on having a big screen, the softwares can change without changing the hardware design.
    > I think it's also unlikely the future smartphones will have much difference. We can get rid of the notch, get rid of the port, maybe make the phone transparent and display content on both sides. Then we end up with a smart glass rectangle. But there's not much we can add as long as the interaction stays the same, with human interacting with a glass rectangular tablet.

  NOTE : Interview with the author of The Dictator's Handbook. An important insight is that, it doesn't benefit a dictator to keep their subjects too wealthy and happy, as that would give them power over you.
  QOTE
    > "Don't pay your supporters too much! You don't want them saving up and forming their own power base. Also, don't be nice to the people at the expense of your coalition. A classic example is natural disasters. Than Shwe was the ruler of Burma when Cyclone Nargis hit in 2008, and he did nothing to help the people. The Generals didn't warn anybody; though they knew it was coming, they provided virtually no emergency protection. He sent the army in to prevent the people from leaving the flooded Delta areas. He was the perfect example of a leader who never made the mistake of putting the people's welfare above himself and his coalition."
    > "Places where there is oil, like Libya, have a very low chance of having democracy. The leaders don't really need the people to pay the bills of their cronies, because they have oil."

    > The world is made of funnels - for every final success, there's a lot of failed attempts. That's why working to publish is a great strategy.
    > For a creator contributing to the world, you can't choose what you are famous for. That's up to the funnel.

    > Buy fruits and vegetables when they are on sale - this is usually due to good harvest or lack of consumer interest. Use them up creatively. Fermentation and stock are two ways to get rid of them.

    > He and Miles both prefer to play more grounded, tonal music, not so much in and out stuff.
    > Miles always strived to innovate, play something different even at the expense of making it sound bad. John on the other hand focuses more on being consistent and making the basic stuff sound great.
  QOTE
    > "Now I feel like I do have my own style, although you can trace everything I play back to somebody else."
    > "I think in a way I'm conservative. I always liked guys like Miles because I play basically tonal music. I've always been fascinated with guys that could play in and out - play on standard things, but play notes that sounded different and had dissonance. But I like the standard forms, the tried and true, whether I'm playing funk or jazz or whatever."

    > "And [Miles] said, 'because I've played the solo I played before.' And I thought, 'this guy wants to change so much that he'd rather sound bad than sound formulated.'"

  NOTE
    > The end-of-life period typically lasts from 10 to 14 days, though in some cases it could be as short as 24 hours.
    > The patient's skin would become cold and wet, due to reduced circulation. But don't cover it with warm clothes as the patient would feel it's too heavy.
    > While the patients would have a hard time breathing, oxygen tank doesn't do a lot as they cannot utilize the oxygen very well.
    > After the patient stops being able to eat & drink, the ketone in their blood would act as painkiller. If they ingest sugar at this point, that painkiller effect would go away immediately.
    > Feeding the patient when they stop being able to eat on their own could make them throw up, or suffocate. IV injection can deliver nutrition & water, but causes pain, bloat, and nausea.
    > End-of-life period often leads to less communication with others, and more with themselves.
    > Most patients are conscious a week before end of their life, but that number drops to 8% when it's 6 hours before their end of life.
    > Death throes are caused by fluids and phlegm. Move patient's body to the side, raise their pillow, or use medicine to reduce the amount of phlegm.

History of salt

  TYPE : article
  TAGS : history, economics
  NOTE
    > Salt and the salt industry had HUGE implications for older human society. 盐商 is famously rich in China. The word "Salary" comes from the Latin word for salt. This is frankly one of the most fascinating subjects I've encountered!
    > What makes salt unique is: it's probably the only life essentials back then, that's both a recurring need, and location-dependent. Therefore it encourages a monopoly to manufacture, and a large scale infrastructure to distribute.
  QOTE
    > Salt's ability to preserve food was a founding contributor to the development of civilization.
    > Many salt roads, such as the via Salaria in Italy, had been established by the Bronze Age.
    > Monopolies over salt production and trade were essential aspects of government revenue in imperial China and retained its significance until 20th century.
    > Salt created and destroyed empires. The salt mines of Poland led to a vast kingdom in the 16th century, only to be demolished when Germans brought in sea salt (which most of the world considered superior to rock salt).
    > In Britain, the suffix "-wich" in a placename means it was once a source of salt, as in Sandwich and Norwich.
    > During the Indian independence movement, Mahatma Gandhi organized the Salt Satyagraha protest to demonstrate against the British salt tax.

    > The song is in the form of a 12 bar blues, dramatically slow, and uses the motif from Marche Funèbre (6-6-6-1-77-66-56).
    > The septet consists of trumpet, trombone, clarinet, sax, piano, bass, and drum. The bass is played with a bow in this song.
    > (1:00) Wycliffe Gordon's trombone playing is out of this world. Extremely varied and expressive, making it weep and growl.
    > (4:29) Victor Goines's clarinet makes use of wailing upward glissando. (5:40) He also shows how even just one continuous note across many bars can have so much variation and expression.
    > (8:50) Wynton Marsalis threw rapidfire note clusters out of his trumpet (9:38). It's almost atonal - understood as texture and rhythm rather than melody. Spliced between calmer melodic lines, like bursts of grief and outrage - or a joke?

    > To make sure they remember something, say it three times. "Tell them what you are going to tell them, then tell them, then tell them again."
    > Fourth tip: Just remembering these tips aren't going to make you a better communicator. That transformation is a process, like going to the gym.

WHY EVERY SINGLE ELEMENT OF SOLID IS WRONG
  LINK : https://www.reddit.com/r/Unity3D/comments/mfeoho/an_example_unity_project_that_uses_a_solid/gso5hbo?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3
  TYPE : forum
  TAGS : code, software architecture, object oriented programming
  NOTE
    > Forum discussion on the tradeoffs of SOLID principle. Interesting discussion that reveals how people could misunderstand or misuse the principles, and what their true intended usages should be.
    > Single Responsibility Principle: Really about separation of concern, and giving classes roles that are easy to understand.
    > Open/Closed Principle: The principle says that classes (, etc...) should allow its behavior be extended without modifying its source code. But this is only useful when there's a high likelihood that the behavior _needs_ to be extended. With good version control practice, it's often less costly to just change the source code when behavior needs to be changed, and revert back and patch stuff in the rare cases when it needs to be changed back.
    > Liskov Substitution Principle: Essentially it says that we should be able to replace a class with its subclass, and expect the program to still behave correctly. This is sensible and good because consistent expectations make it easier to reason about things.
    > Interface Segregation Principle: Interfaces allow us to group relevant methods together, and give them a name that denotes their purpose. This principle calls for breaking apart large interfaces that do it all, into smaller interfaces with specific purposes. This makes sense, and can be thought of similarly to the Single Responsibility Principle - both exist to avoid "God Classes" or "God Interfaces", and make the code easier to understand. Thus, we need to keep the problem this principle intends to solve in mind.
    > Dependency Injection: I must admit that I do not understand this principle.

  DATE : 12021-07-26
  TYPE : video
  NOTE : Allan Holdsworth plays beautiful, unconventional, "outside" solos. He has a unique way of approaching scales; first, think of a scale not as something based off of a single root note or a single position, but an interval-generated pattern across the _entire_ fretboard. Second, "discover" chords out of the scale pattern, instead of the other way around. He has his own ways of notating and calling those scales.

"LEARN THE MODES" IS HORRIBLE ADVICE
  DATE : 12021-07-26
  TAGS : jazz, guitar, improvisation, music theory
  LINK : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWm_dxEszu0
  TYPE : video
  QOTE : "What I think is missing [from the way modes are commonly taught for improvisation] is the ability to relate what we are playing to the chords... the way we think about [modes] is how they are different or the same as a major or minor scale. That's not gonna give us anything that we can play when we improvise over a chord in a song. So instead I think it's more useful to focus on the notes of the chord, the arpeggio, and to get the sound of the chord across in what you're playing."

ALAIN DE BOTTON ON SEX
  LINK : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osd9AKRCFRM
  NOTE
    > Looking objectively, sex is "weird and gross", precisely because it involves two partners accepting the most filthy, poisonous, private part of the other person. That acceptance is sexy.
    > If your problem with sex is having too little of it, it's likely because you are seeing your partner in too many not-sexy situations. Getting out of that state can revitalize that passion.
    > If your problem is too much sex, getting too obsessed with it, well, censorship helps. No matter how much we pretend it doesn't affect us, our brain is programmed to respond to skins. And it's a real problem when we choose to alleviate our anxiety with sex as a distraction.

  QOTE
    Full woman, fleshly apple, hot moon
    thick smell of seaweed, crushed mud and light,
    what obscure brilliance opens between your columns?
    What ancient night does a man touch with his senses?

    Loving is a journey with water and with stars,
    with smothered air and abrupt storms of flour:
    loving is a clash of lightning-bolts
    and two bodies defeated by a single drop of honey.

    Kiss by kiss I move across your small infinity,
    your borders, your rivers, your tiny villages
    and the genital fire transformed into delight

    runs through the narrow pathways of the blood
    until it plunges down, like a dark carnation,
    until it is and is no more than a flash in the night.

HOW TO THINK ABOUT PLEASURE
  LINK : https://psyche.co/guides/from-hedonism-to-humanism-philosophys-defence-of-pleasure
  NOTE
    > I think that, similar to love, pleasure also demands a richer vocabulary.
    > The article touches on taking pleasure in other people's pleasure. This resembles the concept of Eudaimonia in philosophy and positive psychology: the state of well-being that comes from living according to one's virtue, and associated with sense of fulfillment and accomplishment.
    > I also found other articles claiming that eudaimonic happiness is more resistant to the Hedonic Treadmill. Further research required.
  QOTE
    > Pleasure is ridiculously hard to define, partly because it seems so simple.
    > Plenty of philosophers have been wary of the pleasures of the body and have upheld the pleasures of the mind. Of course, that doesn’t mean they were right.
    > One way of defining pleasure is by viewing it as an absence of pain. This tradition reaches back to Epicurus and continues to be a useful way of defending the pursuit of pleasure.
    > People have often sought pleasure in nature, whether it be to feel the sublime immensity of the world or to get away from all those dickheads back home.
    > Taking pleasure in other people’s pleasure is a sure route to becoming a decent sort of person.

  NOTE : Castrato singers were castrated before puberty. Their range and voice is very unique due to the physiological oddity.
  QOTE
    > As the castrato's body grew, his lack of testosterone meant that his epiphyses (bone-joints) did not harden in the normal manner. Thus the limbs of the castrati often grew unusually long, as did their ribs. This, combined with intensive training, gave them unrivalled lung-power and breath capacity.

    > [...] On Sunday, American diplomats returned to this town in the carpeted hills of southern Kenya and announced, much to the delight of the hundreds of Masai gathered in their best beaded finery, that the cattle were not going anywhere, especially not to the slaughterhouse.
    > Instead, they will be blessed, and their offspring will be used to pay for education for the children of Enoosaen. To get the cow trust fund going, the Americans are donating 14 high school scholarships.

  QOTE
    > "[...] had I so interfered in behalf of the rich, the powerful, the intelligent, the so-called great, or in behalf of any of their friends, either father, mother, brother, sister, wife, or children, or any of that class, and suffered and sacrificed what I have in this interference, it would have been all right; and every man in this court would have deemed it an act worthy of reward rather than punishment."
    > "Now, if it is deemed necessary that I should forfeit my life for the furtherance of the ends of justice, and mingle my blood further with the blood of my children and with the blood of millions in this slave country whose rights are disregarded by wicked, cruel, and unjust enactments, I submit; so let it be done!"
    > While Brown was speaking, there was "perfect quiet" in the courtroom.
  NOTE : John Brown's last speech before his death sentence. According to Emerson, the speech is on par with the Gettysburg Address.
