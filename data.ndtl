    "It is also possible to look at the topology of an organisation or a project, and draw conclusions about how it should be managed, and how it could evolve. This is particularly useful when the database becomes very large, and groups of projects, for example, so interwoven as to make it difficult to see the wood for the trees."
    "We should work toward a universal linked information system, in which generality and portability are more important than fancy graphics techniques and complex extra facilities."

  TAGS : personal finance, economy, investment
  QOTE
    If you are not a finance expert, or an expert of the industry you are investing in _and_  intermediately knowledgeable in finance, you are going to be way better off buying index funds of various kinds.
    The less you touch or money and actively trade, the better you will do on average.
    Being “long” means you believe the macro forces at play are going to bring the etf / sector / company up over the long term and you are totally comfortable doing nothing on the peaks and dips, with a plan for what conditions you will sell for upfront (ie: in 5 years, if the stock price doubles, or when I want to buy a PINO).
    It's easier to predict economy on a macro scale, if you can tie it to systemic changes in global economy / industries / power structures, events...
    To reduce risk from volatility:
    1. Average your trades in and out: if you have enough money that the cost of trades is insignificant in relation to the cost of stock you are buying, you should purchase 1/n stock with a fixed frequency, n times. this averages out the volitility of the stock price over that period of time, giving you something closer to the macro value of the stock. You can do this when you sell, too.
    2. Rebalance your assets with a given frequency, say 1-4 times a year. If your due diligence is the same, you should still want to have the same percentage of your money in each of the areas you planned before. This means that if one of your stocks had _sick gains_, you should take those gains and put them with equal percentages into all of your investments, not just continue to bet on the stock that did well with that money. Rebalance your investment percentages back to what you originally decided.
    3. Update your due diligence. Are the macro forces that got you into the investments you have still relevant? What is the current status of the market you are investing in?

    > FTUE: First-time user experience
  NOTE
    Learning how to play a game is where the fun comes from; Be careful however not to confuse the gameplay with its UI. The UI outside the gameplay needs to be clear and intuitive, especially at the beginning of the game, to ensure good FTUE.
    Tutorials need to be fun for the player, and that requires giving them agency during the tutorial.
    Tooltips are powerful way to teach things that are hard to explain to players in VR, so long as it's used in moderation. Reading is hard!
    Pick one between room-scale and seated experience, and stick with it. It's much work to design a game that has to satisfies both.
    Avoid designing the game for one VR controller, and use virtual objects player can interact with in game as UI. Current VR controllers aren't the same across platforms.

    Multiplayer games such as Overwatch & DotA struggle to design its audio. 
    One, because music have to be used sparsely in order to avoid repeating too much and annoying the players; and two, because the sound design affects game balance.
    Playing the music only before game starts give a sense of ceremony, and playing it toward the end of a game adds tension.
    Making footsteps audible, and providing in-game communication tools that are audio based, fill up the void of the soundscape while giving players crucial in-game information.

  QOTE : "But, above all, may they believe in themselves and become as helpless as children. For softness is great and strength is worthless. When a man is born, he is soft and pliable. When he dies, he is strong and hard. When a tree grows, it is soft and pliable. But when it's dry and hard, it dies. Hardness and strength are death's companions. Flexibility and softness are the embodiment of life. That which has become hard shall not triumph."

  QOTE
    "What you do in the game and how you do it is used as the catalyst to drive everything else."
    "I first take the character which you're going to control and replace them with a dot as a placeholder, then I think about what kind of movement would be fun." - Gunpei Yokoi
    "When you could interact with almost everything in the game by using [one strong main mechanic], Nintendo can make a game where the player's range of actions is very small and easy to learn, but the number of things they could interact with is huge."
    "(When it comes to Nintendo's sequels) it's about putting a new twist on an already established mechanics... put those old mechanics in interesting new contexts."
    "(By representing part of the game system, such as camera, targeting system... as characters,) gameplay needn't be abstract systems but organic part of the game world."
    "(Basing the story on the game's main mechanics) might seem like a crazy way to come up with a story, but it can help ensure there's a deep connection between what you do in the game, and what happens in the story."
    "When every aspect of the game is suggesting the way you play it, it becomes effortless to pick the game up and get stuck in."
  NOTE
    Super Mario: A game about jumping. Splatoon: firing ink. A Link Between Worlds: turning into a painting. Luigi's Mansion (gamecube): using a vacuum cleaner.
    All these games start with one single mechanics, and that determines everything from graphical style, sound design, user interface, characters, world setting, and even narrative.

  NOTE
    I played this game twice, in 12013 &amp; 12017. In both playthroughs I let the previous player pass, refused to mercy-kill Julia, and the next player let me pass too.
    It subverts the expectation that characters you interact with in game are NPCs.
    The choice between letting previous player pass or die examines how the player would behave when nobody's watching.
    The answers player types in for the next player, on the other hand, introduces a real vulnerability. The outcome isn't up to the player anymore.
  QOTE
    "There’s a certain codified language about how people approach games, and one of those things is that most of the characters you’ll interact with will be some pre-programmed thing, unless the game is explicitly a multiplayer one. I thought it was an interesting thing to subvert that expectation: you don’t realise the other player is actually a player. You see them as an NPC."
    "(Moirai) forced you to assess yourself: how you comport yourself when you think no one’s listening."

Using Anki to learn chords
  QOTE : "I would recommend putting in chord progressions (like in a normal song) rather than single chords. Also make sure to actually form the chords, either on the piano (definitely much better), or on the table (in a pinch). This will allow you to learn the chords in context and give your hands muscle memory, especially with common transitions."

Categorizing creative systems
  TYPE : quote
  DATE : 12018-11-13
  TAGS : generative
  DONE : true
  QOTE
    1. Domain & Creative Task: Does it produce poetry? music? visual art? cinema? game? If it produces music, does it compose? perform? improvise?

    2. How specific or generic is the system. e.g. AARON's output has a very specific style, while the Continuator can imitate many styles of music. Often, artistic systems are more specific, while researching / scientific systems are more generic.

    3. Level of autonomy. How much human involvement is needed? AARON paints new paintings on demand without any human input, while the continuator only works with a human partner.

    4. Interactivity: if the system interacts with human, and in what way. Low level interactivity: the system only reacts to its input, like most apps with a GUI. A text editor interacts with you this way. High level interactivity: aka Agent Interaction, or Conversational Interactivity. the actions of the creative system affects the actions of the human.

    5. Time: The generative process can happen in real time, or ahead of time.

    6. Origin of the system's knowledge. Encoded Knowledge, Input Knowledge, and Knowledge learned - extracted from some input data.

    7. System's pattern of behavior, as if they are artificial lives. Christopher Langton's 4 classes of behavior. Fixed behavior: static output. Periodic behavior: system has recurrent behaviors. Chaotic behavior: no discernable patterns. Complex behavior: the sweet spot between Periodic and Chaotic behavior. Where we can find the most intelligent outputs. ˀ"Complex" here refers to the output of the system, not the complexity of the process. 

    8. Architecture of the system. Purely generative system takes some input, and then simply outputs. Feedback loop or reflexive system separates the generation and evaluation; the evaluation affects the generation. Interactive, or adaptive system, adds the audience, user, or environment of the output into feedback.

    "From there, the subsidiary pitches were written in to produce the repetition of each scale, and then Coltrane grouped them, for reasons that were entirely related to theory and go beyond a chromatic modulation. I suspect the numbers were written on last, perhaps just after the connecting spokes were drawn."

  QOTE
    Innovation Trigger: A potential technology breakthrough kicks things off. Early proof-of-concept stories and media interest trigger significant publicity. Often no usable products exist and commercial viability is unproven.
    Peak of Inflated Expectations: Early publicity produces a number of success stories — often accompanied by scores of failures. Some companies take action; many do not.
    Trough of Disillusionment: Interest wanes as experiments and implementations fail to deliver. Producers of the technology shake out or fail. Investments continue only if the surviving providers improve their products to the satisfaction of early adopters.
    Slope of Enlightenment: More instances of how the technology can benefit the enterprise start to crystallize and become more widely understood. Second- and third-generation products appear from technology providers. More enterprises fund pilots; conservative companies remain cautious.
    Plateau of Productivity: Mainstream adoption starts to take off. Criteria for assessing provider viability are more clearly defined. The technology's broad market applicability and relevance are clearly paying off.

  QOTE : "Meteoric iron or 'sky-iron' (Tib. gnam lcags) is the supreme substance for forging the physical representation of the vajra or other iron weapons, since it has already been tempered by the celestial gods in its passage across the heavens. The indivisibility of form and emptiness is a perfect metaphor for the image of a meteorite or 'stone fallen from the sky', manifesting out of the voidness of space as a shooting star or fireball, and depositing a chunk of fused 'sky iron' on the earth below. Many vajras held by deities as weapons are described as being forged from meteorite iron, and Tibet, with its high altitude, thin atmosphere and desolate landscape, received an abundance of meteorite fragments. Tibetan vajras were often cast from meteorite iron, and as an act of sympathetic magic a piece of the meteoric iron was often returned to its original site."

  NOTE : One of the outer planes in DnD Great Wheel Cosmology.
  QOTE : "The four layers of Gehenna were infinite planes with gravity at a forty-five degree angle to the ground, making travelers feel as if they were on the side of a mountain with no base or peak. Anyone losing their footing could tumble for miles/kilometers before finding enough purchase on the slope to halt their fall."

  NOTE
    > Use a thick cut so that the outside has time to brown and form crust before the inside is dried out.
    > Pat the steak surface dry.
    > Season both sides evenly.
    > Make sure there's a good layer of fat underneath the steak, so it browns evenly.
    > Keep basting with those browned nutty butter. If butter got too burned, add more butter.
    > Inner temperature should be just around 50C.
    > Take it out of the pan and let rest for 5 minutes.
    > More butter!

Common Japanese Chord Progressions (Part 1)

  TYPE : video
  TAGS : rock, math rock, japanese music, japan, chord, music, music theory
  DATE : 12019-08-09
  NOTE
    > Interesting that japanese styles of progression is also found in CHON's music, and other math rock bands in the state. The influence could have came from video game and anime.
    > IV (V7) iii vi progression. The turnaround could be vi V IV, or vi V I IV (2-5-1)
    > IV V vi progression
    > {VI} chords. This is borrowed from A Major. This works because you can think of C Major as A minor. Use VIsus to add ambiguity and allow us to resolve to either VI or vi.
    > {bVII} chords. This can be seen as borrowed from the parallel minor, or as neapolitan chord of vi.

  TYPE : video
  TAGS : rock, math rock, japanese music, japan, chord, music, music theory
  DATE : 12019-08-11
  NOTE
    > IV iii progression. Simplified from IV iii vi. A floating feeling.
    > We can tell the key of a song without the tonic chord ever being used in the progression, by watching out for half-steps chord changes. If it's between a minor and major chord, it's iii and IV. If diminished and major, it's viidim and I.
    > maj#11 chord, or the lydian chord, is also a strong indicator of tonality. With IV as the root it's 3467 of the major scale it belongs to. the 4 and 7 wants to resolve to 3 and 1 (iii).
    > {viiº/vi} or {bviº}: the viiº chord borrowed from a harmonic minor scale from vi. Think of it as another way to approach vi. Can also try {bVI}
    > {bII/IV} or {#IV}: The neapolitan chord of IV - it's the 2nd chord of a phrygian (34567123) scale from IV. Think of it as another way to approach IV.

  NOTE
    > Synopsis: While technology always improves, human change at a much slower pace. We will always want a phone we can comfortably hold and keep in our pockets. And because our phone focuses on having a big screen, the softwares can change without changing the hardware design.
    > I think it's also unlikely the future smartphones will have much difference. We can get rid of the notch, get rid of the port, maybe make the phone transparent and display content on both sides. Then we end up with a smart glass rectangle. But there's not much we can add as long as the interaction stays the same, with human interacting with a glass rectangular tablet.

  NOTE : Interview with the author of The Dictator's Handbook. An important insight is that, it doesn't benefit a dictator to keep their subjects too wealthy and happy, as that would give them power over you.
  QOTE
    > "Don't pay your supporters too much! You don't want them saving up and forming their own power base. Also, don't be nice to the people at the expense of your coalition. A classic example is natural disasters. Than Shwe was the ruler of Burma when Cyclone Nargis hit in 2008, and he did nothing to help the people. The Generals didn't warn anybody; though they knew it was coming, they provided virtually no emergency protection. He sent the army in to prevent the people from leaving the flooded Delta areas. He was the perfect example of a leader who never made the mistake of putting the people's welfare above himself and his coalition."
    > "Places where there is oil, like Libya, have a very low chance of having democracy. The leaders don't really need the people to pay the bills of their cronies, because they have oil."

    > The world is made of funnels - for every final success, there's a lot of failed attempts. That's why working to publish is a great strategy.
    > For a creator contributing to the world, you can't choose what you are famous for. That's up to the funnel.

  QOTE
    > "Now I feel like I do have my own style, although you can trace everything I play back to somebody else."
    > "I think in a way I'm conservative. I always liked guys like Miles because I play basically tonal music. I've always been fascinated with guys that could play in and out - play on standard things, but play notes that sounded different and had dissonance. But I like the standard forms, the tried and true, whether I'm playing funk or jazz or whatever."

  NOTE
    > The end-of-life period typically lasts from 10 to 14 days, though in some cases it could be as short as 24 hours.
    > The patient's skin would become cold and wet, due to reduced circulation. But don't cover it with warm clothes as the patient would feel it's too heavy.
    > While the patients would have a hard time breathing, oxygen tank doesn't do a lot as they cannot utilize the oxygen very well.
    > After the patient stops being able to eat & drink, the ketone in their blood would act as painkiller. If they ingest sugar at this point, that painkiller effect would go away immediately.
    > Feeding the patient when they stop being able to eat on their own could make them throw up, or suffocate. IV injection can deliver nutrition & water, but causes pain, bloat, and nausea.
    > End-of-life period often leads to less communication with others, and more with themselves.
    > Most patients are conscious a week before end of their life, but that number drops to 8% when it's 6 hours before their end of life.
    > Death throes are caused by fluids and phlegm. Move patient's body to the side, raise their pillow, or use medicine to reduce the amount of phlegm.

History of salt
  DATE : 12021-01-30
  LINK : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_salt
  TYPE : article
  TAGS : history, economics
  NOTE
    > Salt and the salt industry had HUGE implications for older human society. 盐商 is famously rich in China. The word "Salary" comes from the Latin word for salt. This is frankly one of the most fascinating subjects I've encountered!
    > What makes salt unique is: it's probably the only life essentials back then, that's both a recurring need, and location-dependent. Therefore it encourages a monopoly to manufacture, and a large scale infrastructure to distribute.
  QOTE
    > Salt's ability to preserve food was a founding contributor to the development of civilization.
    > Many salt roads, such as the via Salaria in Italy, had been established by the Bronze Age.
    > Monopolies over salt production and trade were essential aspects of government revenue in imperial China and retained its significance until 20th century.
    > Salt created and destroyed empires. The salt mines of Poland led to a vast kingdom in the 16th century, only to be demolished when Germans brought in sea salt (which most of the world considered superior to rock salt).
    > In Britain, the suffix "-wich" in a placename means it was once a source of salt, as in Sandwich and Norwich.
    > During the Indian independence movement, Mahatma Gandhi organized the Salt Satyagraha protest to demonstrate against the British salt tax.

  NOTE
    > Agree with the vine metaphor. Skeptical however regarding momentum - sometimes stillness is not inaction.
    > Another reason to change careers like tarzan: if the new vine doesn't support you, you could look for more opportunities and understandings by climbing up the old vine.

    > Chords: 8 bar of Em Em Em Em C C Am F
    > Shape-wise, the solo starts with slower, melodic lines, with lots of gaps, and played on the low end of the keyboard. Gradually it raises intensity, until the end where it's a continuous run of high trill-filled 16th notes.
    > Cory Henry plays lots of chromatic, but at the end of reels back to the stable Minor Pentatonic scale with bluesy lick.

Wynton Marsalis Septet - The Death of Jazz (The New Orleans Function)
  DATE : 12021-02-26
  TYPE : music
  TAGS : jazz, trumpet, trombone
  LINK : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKHM53iv2VI
  NOTE
    > The song is in the form of a 12 bar blues, dramatically slow, and uses the motif from Marche Funèbre (6-6-6-1-77-66-56).
    > The septet consists of trumpet, trombone, clarinet, sax, piano, bass, and drum. The bass is played with a bow in this song.
    > (1:00) Wycliffe Gordon's trombone playing is out of this world. Extremely varied and expressive, making it weep and growl.
    > (4:29) Victor Goines's clarinet makes use of wailing upward glissando. (5:40) He also shows how even just one continuous note across many bars can have so much variation and expression.
    > (8:50) Wynton Marsalis threw rapidfire note clusters out of his trumpet (9:38). It's almost atonal - understood as texture and rhythm rather than melody. Spliced between calmer melodic lines, like bursts of grief and outrage - or a joke?

  QOTE
    > When speaking, communicate no more than three points to your audience. More than that, and they will forget.
    > Explain a difficult thing in three different ways. People learn in different ways - visual, aural, kinesthetic. Present the information in different ways to cover different audiences.
    > To make sure they remember something, say it three times. "Tell them what you are going to tell them, then tell them, then tell them again."
    > Fourth tip: Just remembering these tips aren't going to make you a better communicator. That transformation is a process, like going to the gym.
    > "we're built to connect with another person. In spite of the fact that we often avoid it, it actually is fun when we get into that position."
